The Merchant of Ferona
by Jeremy Astolfi
Interactive Media Development Final Project

Project Idea
	The premise of "The Merchant of Ferona" is to take a look at the travel of a roaming merchant (The yellow character) who goes to towns and cities (represented with the Houses) to sell items to the townspeople (The dark green-brown characters). He is accompanied by an apprentice (The grey character). The merchant travels across the small land of Ferona approaching every town and pausing to give the idea of trading and selling everytime a townsperson approaches him.

Controls
Arrow Keys (Up & Down) - Zoom in & out respectively for the camera
Arrow Keys (Left & Right) - Rotate the camera to see the character interactions and the world
Space - Resets the entire scenario (Meant to reset or start a new day). * Will be necessary after you have passed the last town, after all no one needs to buy more of your wares more than once a day! *

Advanced Behaviours
Path Following - The merchant follows a path based on waypoints dotted across the land
Arrival - The merchant, apprentice and townspeople all share arrival. The merchant arrives to specific waypoints close to the towns and the townspeople share said waypoint to see the merchant. The apprentice uses arrival to not ram into his master.
Leader Following - The apprentice follows the merchant as a leader.
Queuing - The townspeople go into a queue state once the merchant approaches a close distance. Some will wait to see your wares; others impatiently look and leave to return home.

Postmortem
	I had intended to add wolves to make the travel share every fantasy game's ultimate enemy, but felt that it could interfere with the travel too much. I feel that the character could have been modeled, but I felt it irrelevant after realizing the programming is more important. I also wanted to have a larger more expansive land, but I feel the world would then outstay its welcome.
